#  Setting up a test environment

= Setting up a Test Environment for RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant

To effectively demonstrate the capabilities of the RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant, it's essential to set up a test environment. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to create a controlled environment for hands-on practice.

## Prerequisites

1. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system with root access.
2. The command-line assistant enabled.

## Step 1: Prepare the Test System

Ensure your test system meets the minimum requirements and has the necessary packages installed. In this example, we'll use Apache HTTP Server (httpd) for demonstration purposes.

## Step 2: Install Apache HTTP Server

If Apache HTTP Server is not already installed, use the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo yum install httpd
```

## Step 3: Verify Apache HTTP Server Installation

To confirm the installation, list the installed httpd package version:

```bash
sudo rpm -qa httpd
```

You should see an output similar to:

```
httpd-2.4.62-2.fc40.x86_64
```

## Step 4: Check httpd.conf File

The main Apache HTTP Server configuration file is `httpd.conf`. Verify its content with the following command:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

## Step 5: Query httpd Packages

List all httpd-related packages installed on your system:

```bash
sudo rpm -qa httpdq
```

## Step 6: Identify Ports

Determine the ports on which the web server accepts incoming requests:

```bash
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
```

## Step 7: Set Up SELinux Contexts (if needed)

If you encounter SELinux-related issues, use the command-line assistant to identify and set contexts. For example, to check for the `httpd_var_run_t` context:

```bash
c "i don't have a httpd_var_run_t contexts"
```

The assistant will provide suggestions, such as:

```bash
sudo chcon -R -t httpd
